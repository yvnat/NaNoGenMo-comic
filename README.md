The final goal of this project is to generate a readable comic with a premise loosly based on Xenophon's Anabasis.

The overarching story, on a broad page-by-page level, is generated by the Simulator. Each individual event reported by the Simulator (for example, a skirmish) is then turned into a detailed description of a comic page by the Elaborator, and that description is turned into a readable page by the Illustrator.

Current Progress:

| Simulator | Elaborator | Illustrator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic Implementation | Basic Implementation | Partial Implementation |

A basic implementation is necessary for all parts of the program to create a preliminary comic page.
